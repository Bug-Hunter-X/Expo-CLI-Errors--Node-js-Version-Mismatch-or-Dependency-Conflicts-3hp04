This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI with older versions of Node.js or when there are conflicts with other globally installed packages.  The error message itself can vary, but it often involves issues with loading modules or finding required dependencies. For example, you might see messages about `ENOTFOUND`, `EACCES`, or other system errors.  The code causing the error isn't directly in your app, but rather within the Expo CLI's interaction with the system.
